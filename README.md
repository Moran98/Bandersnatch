# Bandersnatch - G00356519
This game is based off of the TV Series Black Mirror who released an interactive movie on Netflix making the viewer to make decisions throughout the movoie. The game concept i have made makes the user make interactive choices which will lead to different types of consequences and multiple endings to the story. Each decision leads to a new path and opens new ending possibilites.
