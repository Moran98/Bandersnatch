# Bandersnatch - G00356519

## Overview
This game is a concept of the book *Through the Looking Glass  : by Lewis Carol* and the Movie *Bandersnatch : Black Mirror* who released an interactive movie on Netflix making the viewer to make decisions throughout the movie. The game is designed for the user to question their decisions and which path to take. The game concept i have made makes the user make interactive choices which will lead to different types of consequences and multiple endings to the story. Each decision leads to a new path and opens new ending possibilites, if any at all. 

## Aim Of The Game
The aim of the game is to make the user fail time and time again while trying to uncover the hidden endings to the story. The game will take many failures to fully encounter each of the endings. Simple concept of if you fail at one hurdle, try again and when you reach the same stage choose the other hurdle as it will lead you down a path with multiple different outcomes being revealed.
